# 📘 Generative AI Text Generation Project
*A practical implementation of a lightweight generative model using LSTM neural networks*

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of **Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI)** by implementing a simple text generation model using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
The model is trained on the public-domain text *Alice in Wonderland* from Project Gutenberg and uses an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** network to generate new text sequences based on a seed input.

This project helps illustrate:
- How generative models learn linguistic patterns  
- How next-word prediction works  
- The difference between small LSTM models and GPT-style transformers  
- Ethical considerations in AI

## 📌 Key Features
- ✔ Word-level tokenization using Keras Tokenizer  
- ✔ Sequence generation from raw text  
- ✔ LSTM-based generative neural network  
- ✔ Next-word prediction text generation  
- ✔ Visualization of training accuracy/loss  
- ✔ Ethical considerations of Generative AI  
- ✔ Exportable notebook for PDF submission

## 🧠 Model Architecture
The implemented model uses:
- **Embedding Layer** – Converts tokens into word vectors  
- **LSTM Layer (128 units)** – Learns sequential text patterns  
- **Dense Softmax Output Layer** – Predicts the next word  

This lightweight architecture is designed to run efficiently within free Google Colab RAM limits.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Upload the Dataset
Download “Alice in Wonderland (Plain Text UTF-8)” and upload it in Colab:
```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
```

### 2. Import Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
```

### 3. Train the Model
```python
model.fit(X, y, epochs=5, batch_size=128)
```
Training accuracy rises from ~4% to ~11%.

### 4. Generate Text
```python
print(generate_text("alice looked around", 40))
```

## 📊 Results Summary
- The model successfully learned basic linguistic patterns.  
- Accuracy improved across epochs (approximately 4% → 11%).  
- Generated text showed simple sequencing patterns typical of small LSTMs.  
- Demonstrated the foundational principle of next-word prediction.  
- Highlights contrast between small models vs. large GPT architectures.

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations
The project discusses the following:
- **Bias** in training data  
- **Privacy risks** and potential data leakage  
- **Misinformation** generated by AI systems  
- **Copyright concerns** when using protected datasets  
- **Responsible deployment** practices  

These considerations are essential when building and deploying generative AI tools.
